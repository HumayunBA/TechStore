*The Tech Store website is built using the "mobile first" method. It consists of 3 pages: Main page, Log in page and Check out page. All of them are united by the same style of the header. Header contains clickable website name "Tech Store" on the left, which brings you to the main page, log in sign (or log out sign, depends on if a user is inlogged or not) to get to Log in page, the number of products in your shopping cart and the check out sign to proceed to your cart.*

## Log In

*The log in sign on the header changes its direction depending on if the user is logged in or not. On the log in page, when no one is logged in, the user sees the log in form where he has options to enter email and password to log in into existing account or mark the check box to register new user. After the user is logged in the form changes to the list of completed orders. The list consists of cards with images and names of phones user had already bought and the total price of orders.*
